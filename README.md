# Youtube Subtitle Generator
A simple and easy way to obtain subtitle transcriptions for any Youtube video! <br />
Deployed Website: https://alexeum31.github.io/Youtube-Subtitle-Generator/
# My Approach
I used HTML and CSS to design and format my page. Furthermore, I used Javascript to make my web application interactive by fetching data from the Youtube Subtitles API. Finally, I used Github pages to deploy my website.
# Inspiration
As the Speech and Debate coach of The Bronx High School of Science, I often have to compile evidence by transcribing Youtube videos by hand. This process was very tedious and often took hours to transcribe a 20-minute video. With this website, I exponentially reduce the time it takes me to create evidence by getting access to transcribed subtitles. 
An additional feature I can add is to fix punctuation and capitalization that the subtitles may not always catch.
